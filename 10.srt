1
00:00:01,842 --> 00:00:03,621
Previously on Pretty Little Liars.

2
00:00:03,662 --> 00:00:04,897
Is this what you're looking for?

3
00:00:05,474 --> 00:00:08,747
Ezra is taking on these big
responsibilities. And he needs a job.

4
00:00:08,897 --> 00:00:10,112
The park rangers found a body.

5
00:00:10,162 --> 00:00:11,078
It was Toby.

6
00:00:13,384 --> 00:00:15,317
No, Spence, it wasn't.

7
00:00:15,318 --> 00:00:18,351
Will you just tell me that what
I saw tonight wasn't real?

8
00:00:18,352 --> 00:00:19,885
Please, tell me.

9
00:00:19,886 --> 00:00:21,319
I'm here to pick up Malcolm.

10
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:22,519
Your friend picked me up instead.

11
00:00:22,520 --> 00:00:24,253
She said her name was Alison.

12
00:00:24,254 --> 00:00:26,053
They just found a body tonight.
 Where?

13
00:00:26,054 --> 00:00:27,354
Exactly where Spencer said it was.

14
00:00:27,438 --> 00:00:29,751
I don't think that
I can do this, anymore.

15
00:00:29,786 --> 00:00:31,334
Look at all that's happened
since you turned me down on

16
00:00:31,335 --> 00:00:34,182
our little drive up the Mountain.

17
00:00:38,302 --> 00:00:41,786
You don't have to ask
me again, Mona. I'm in.

18
00:00:47,817 --> 00:00:49,324
Maybe she's just
as nervous about

19
00:00:49,325 --> 00:00:51,166
seeing us as we are
about seeing her.

20
00:00:51,167 --> 00:00:52,740
Guys, she's the exact same Spencer

21
00:00:52,741 --> 00:00:54,382
that we saw last week.

22
00:00:54,383 --> 00:00:56,695
No, the Spencer we saw in Radley
was not the Spencer I know.

23
00:00:56,696 --> 00:00:58,000
That was before.

24
00:00:59,845 --> 00:01:02,222
Em, we're not just here for
her, we're for you, too.

25
00:01:05,512 --> 00:01:06,978
Do we talk about him?

26
00:01:06,979 --> 00:01:09,247
Do we bring it up?

27
00:01:09,248 --> 00:01:12,415
I don't want to say anything
that could put her back there.

28
00:01:15,050 --> 00:01:17,584
I know they said
they found Toby,

29
00:01:17,585 --> 00:01:19,885
but they sent that second
body to the state coroner

30
00:01:19,886 --> 00:01:22,387
for a reason. I mean,
maybe there's hope.

31
00:01:23,723 --> 00:01:25,687
You know how I feel about hope.

32
00:01:27,823 --> 00:01:29,590
Breeds eternal misery.

33
00:01:32,260 --> 00:01:34,727
We lost Toby a long time ago.

34
00:01:34,728 --> 00:01:36,461
We just didn't know it.

35
00:01:37,696 --> 00:01:40,229
Oh, you've got to love
the Hastings.

36
00:01:40,230 --> 00:01:42,063
I just get released
from a mental hospital,

37
00:01:42,064 --> 00:01:46,032
and they welcome my friends
with tea and crumpets.

38
00:01:46,033 --> 00:01:47,667
What's the difference
between a crumpet

39
00:01:47,668 --> 00:01:48,700
and an English muffin?

40
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:50,448
Hanna, does it matter?

41
00:01:50,449 --> 00:01:52,517
I'm just making conversation.

42
00:01:52,518 --> 00:01:54,818
An English muffin is a baked bread.
It's made of dough.

43
00:01:54,819 --> 00:01:58,922
And a crumpet is a griddle cake

44
00:01:58,957 --> 00:02:00,986
made of batter.

45
00:02:01,423 --> 00:02:03,132
How are you, Spence?

46
00:02:04,382 --> 00:02:05,329
I'm all right.

47
00:02:05,629 --> 00:02:07,622
You know, you don't have to
pretend to be okay for us.

48
00:02:07,669 --> 00:02:09,347
Yeah, if this was
the act you had to pull off

49
00:02:09,348 --> 00:02:10,924
to get out of there, then...

50
00:02:10,925 --> 00:02:13,644
Do you remember when you were
in the light house, Emily?

51
00:02:13,645 --> 00:02:15,996
And you had to make
that choice?

52
00:02:15,997 --> 00:02:18,179
It was either him or you?

53
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:21,973
I wasn't as strong as you were.

54
00:02:21,974 --> 00:02:24,625
When I saw Toby in the woods,

55
00:02:24,626 --> 00:02:27,749
like that, I just gave up.

56
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:29,830
So what changed?

57
00:02:29,831 --> 00:02:31,812
You seem like you're
back to yourself.

58
00:02:32,338 --> 00:02:34,671
I decided I didn't want
to be victim any more.

59
00:02:37,769 --> 00:02:40,014
That's not who I am.

60
00:02:41,288 --> 00:02:43,602
Here.

61
00:02:43,603 --> 00:02:45,042
What's this?

62
00:02:45,043 --> 00:02:47,523
My parents told all of
their friends that I went

63
00:02:47,524 --> 00:02:49,333
to Radley for exhaustion,
so they want to throw

64
00:02:49,334 --> 00:02:50,942
a soiree to make sure
that everybody knows that

65
00:02:50,943 --> 00:02:52,351
I'm all better now.

66
00:02:55,974 --> 00:02:58,084
Could really use some support.

67
00:02:58,134 --> 00:02:59,194
Can you guys please come?

68
00:02:59,269 --> 00:03:00,473
Of course.

69
00:03:00,906 --> 00:03:02,249
Sure.
Yeah, you know

70
00:03:02,250 --> 00:03:04,902
we'd do anything for you.

71
00:03:04,903 --> 00:03:08,260
I'm counting on that.

Did Malcolm tell you
what she looked like?

88
00:04:36,055 --> 00:04:37,840
No, he just said she
was a friend of mine,

89
00:04:37,841 --> 00:04:39,358
and her name was Alison.
That's all I know.

90
00:04:39,359 --> 00:04:41,447
Well, look... you have to
talk to him, find out more.

91
00:04:41,448 --> 00:04:44,820
Yeah, like did she have dark
hair, horns, and a tail?

92
00:04:44,821 --> 00:04:48,630
Guys, no, we are not using
Malcolm to get to Mona.

93
00:04:48,631 --> 00:04:50,317
You know, the last time
I saw Ezra

94
00:04:50,318 --> 00:04:51,834
I could hardly face him.

95
00:04:51,836 --> 00:04:53,520
All we have to do is show
Mona's picture to the kid.

96
00:04:53,521 --> 00:04:55,205
He'll confirm that Mona took him
and the cops will

97
00:04:55,206 --> 00:04:57,431
take our lulu-head
back to the nut farm.

98
00:04:58,780 --> 00:05:00,668
Hanna.

99
00:05:00,669 --> 00:05:02,759
Sorry, Spence.
My bad.

100
00:05:04,177 --> 00:05:05,895
I don't know,
it seems like a really

101
00:05:05,896 --> 00:05:07,346
bold move for Mona.

102
00:05:07,347 --> 00:05:10,075
The risk being seen like that?

103
00:05:10,076 --> 00:05:12,470
What are you saying, Spence?

104
00:05:12,471 --> 00:05:13,684
It feels desperate.

105
00:05:13,685 --> 00:05:15,444
Like maybe she's
trying to get caught.

106
00:05:15,568 --> 00:05:18,773
Okay, well, Malcolm
is off limits, okay?

107
00:05:18,774 --> 00:05:20,562
Gotta get to class.

108
00:05:25,017 --> 00:05:26,838
I can use some extra money.

109
00:05:26,839 --> 00:05:28,391
Did you not just hear Aria?

110
00:05:28,392 --> 00:05:30,956
Em, kids love me.
I'll make a game out of it.

111
00:05:30,957 --> 00:05:33,690
Hey, Emily.
Hey.

112
00:05:33,691 --> 00:05:35,141
What-uh-what are you doing here?

113
00:05:35,142 --> 00:05:36,727
Our coach arranged
for us to practice

114
00:05:36,728 --> 00:05:37,942
here this morning.

115
00:05:37,943 --> 00:05:40,777
But I say if it's water,
it's wet, right?

116
00:05:40,778 --> 00:05:43,036
A pool's a pool.

117
00:05:43,037 --> 00:05:45,297
I don't think we've met.

118
00:05:45,298 --> 00:05:49,045
Uh, Shana, this is Spencer.

119
00:05:49,046 --> 00:05:50,631
Uh, you swim for Oakwood?

120
00:05:50,632 --> 00:05:53,499
Amongst other things.
Will you be at the meet?

121
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:55,255
Yeah. Wouldn't miss it.

122
00:05:55,256 --> 00:05:58,257
I'll look for you.
Good luck, Emily.

123
00:05:58,258 --> 00:06:00,484
You, too.

124
00:06:03,017 --> 00:06:05,244
I hate her.
Why?

125
00:06:05,245 --> 00:06:09,057
Because she flirts with
everyone but me.

126
00:06:09,058 --> 00:06:10,340
Shana's bad news.

127
00:06:10,341 --> 00:06:12,905
Wherever she goes,
trouble follows.

128
00:06:18,743 --> 00:06:21,409
Well, it was great seeing you.

129
00:06:21,410 --> 00:06:22,455
Take care.

130
00:06:24,784 --> 00:06:27,349
Hey.
Hey.

131
00:06:27,350 --> 00:06:30,015
Did you have another interview?

132
00:06:30,016 --> 00:06:32,545
Yeah, they called this morning.

133
00:06:32,546 --> 00:06:34,199
Well, that's good.

134
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:35,414
Probably means that
they're interested

135
00:06:35,415 --> 00:06:37,372
in having you back.

136
00:06:37,373 --> 00:06:40,746
I don't think it's
going to work out for me.

137
00:06:40,747 --> 00:06:42,536
Oh, I'm sorry.

138
00:06:59,714 --> 00:07:03,728
You said you were going
to make it all go away.

139
00:07:03,729 --> 00:07:06,564
I'm worried that the police
have evidence.

140
00:07:07,078 --> 00:07:10,261
Look, I need to see you today.

141
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:30,458
I've got to go.
Bye.

142
00:07:43,948 --> 00:07:45,870
I just got off
the phone with your mom.

143
00:07:46,419 --> 00:07:48,414
Did you know that Ezra
was applying for

144
00:07:48,424 --> 00:07:49,809
a teaching job
at Rosewood High?

145
00:07:50,072 --> 00:07:52,376
Yeah, he applied for a job
subbing in the district.

146
00:07:53,037 --> 00:07:56,490
Listen, your mom and I
recognise that Ezra

147
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:58,441
needs to find a way
to support his son.

148
00:07:58,521 --> 00:08:01,772
But he cannot teach in Rosewood if
you two are still seeing each other.

149
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,160
You're leaving us no choice...

150
00:08:03,318 --> 00:08:07,625
Dad, slow down, okay.
He's not getting the job.

151
00:08:07,626 --> 00:08:10,060
He was offered the position
this morning, Aria.

152
00:08:11,663 --> 00:08:14,265
Ezra asked for the day to
decide if he wants to take it.

153
00:08:18,937 --> 00:08:22,475
So, Aria didn't tell me that you
were interested in the job.

154
00:08:22,476 --> 00:08:24,342
Oh, well, I didn't tell
her because I didn't want

155
00:08:24,343 --> 00:08:26,811
to feel pressured if you
gave me the gig. Ahh.

156
00:08:26,812 --> 00:08:28,480
Thank you.

157
00:08:28,481 --> 00:08:31,049
So, Malcolm's seven, right?
 Mm-hmm.

158
00:08:31,050 --> 00:08:34,052
What's he into?
Fast cars and fast girls?

159
00:08:36,189 --> 00:08:39,725
It's a joke.
He's into trains.

160
00:08:39,726 --> 00:08:42,662
Oh! Well, all aboard the Hanna express.

161
00:08:44,932 --> 00:08:48,468
Um, do you have
a resume, or anything?

162
00:08:48,469 --> 00:08:50,937
Honestly, I haven't
baby sat since I was 15.

163
00:08:50,938 --> 00:08:53,374
But my mom's in New York,
Caleb's out of town,

164
00:08:53,375 --> 00:08:54,676
so, I have a lot
of time to kill.

165
00:08:54,677 --> 00:08:57,377
And I could use
the extra money.

166
00:08:57,378 --> 00:09:00,214
Okay. I have an
appointment tonight,

167
00:09:00,215 --> 00:09:02,650
so, if you're free,

168
00:09:02,651 --> 00:09:04,619
we can give it a test run.

169
00:09:04,620 --> 00:09:06,321
See if it's a good fit.

170
00:09:06,322 --> 00:09:08,223
Well, it will be, promise.

171
00:09:29,714 --> 00:09:31,614
I've missed you.

172
00:09:36,555 --> 00:09:38,856
They'll all be together
this Friday.

173
00:09:38,857 --> 00:09:41,058
You know what you need to do.

174
00:09:41,059 --> 00:09:45,429
Yeah. What did the
doctor say about your eyes?

175
00:09:45,430 --> 00:09:48,766
Um, I'll have good days
and bad days.

176
00:09:48,767 --> 00:09:51,971
Eventually they'll all be bad.

177
00:10:00,313 --> 00:10:02,047
On your darkest days,

178
00:10:02,048 --> 00:10:03,916
you know I'll be here for you.

179
00:10:11,926 --> 00:10:13,627
Hey.

180
00:10:20,968 --> 00:10:22,469
Is everything okay?

181
00:10:24,106 --> 00:10:26,740
Why didn't you tell me that
they offered you the job?

182
00:10:28,844 --> 00:10:31,113
'Cause I don't think
I'm going to take it.

183
00:10:31,114 --> 00:10:34,415
And I didn't think you should share
in the burden of that decision.

184
00:10:34,416 --> 00:10:37,052
You need a job, Ezra.
Yeah,

185
00:10:37,053 --> 00:10:39,221
but you know what would
happen to us if I end up

186
00:10:39,222 --> 00:10:41,689
back at Rosewood.

187
00:10:41,690 --> 00:10:45,295
Things are different now.
People know about us.

188
00:10:45,296 --> 00:10:47,797
Hey, don't... don't cry.
Don't cry.

189
00:10:47,798 --> 00:10:50,498
We're okay.
No, we're not.

190
00:10:52,669 --> 00:10:55,771
Nothing about
us feels right anymore.

191
00:10:58,843 --> 00:11:00,945
I'm sorry.

192
00:11:00,946 --> 00:11:03,713
It's not your fault.
I want to fix this.

193
00:11:03,714 --> 00:11:05,114
I know.

194
00:11:05,115 --> 00:11:08,718
I know, but you can't.

195
00:11:08,719 --> 00:11:11,956
Okay, we've been chasing
after what we used to have

196
00:11:11,957 --> 00:11:16,094
ever since you found out
about Malcolm, but...

197
00:11:16,095 --> 00:11:18,496
I just don't...

198
00:11:18,497 --> 00:11:21,099
I don't think that
we can ever get that back.

199
00:11:25,271 --> 00:11:29,075
Things aren't easy,
but they can still be good.

200
00:11:29,076 --> 00:11:31,077
It shouldn't be this hard.

201
00:11:35,683 --> 00:11:39,151
If you're not happy anymore...

202
00:11:41,955 --> 00:11:44,191
You know, that's
what matters most to me.

203
00:11:48,062 --> 00:11:51,632
Hey, I love you just
as much as I always have.

204
00:11:53,167 --> 00:11:55,802
And that's why I want you
to take this job.

205
00:12:04,046 --> 00:12:06,482
Aria, wait, wait.

206
00:12:10,685 --> 00:12:12,020
I love you.

Hanna got the job.

220
00:13:48,986 --> 00:13:50,654
I know.

221
00:13:56,894 --> 00:13:58,594
Spencer.

222
00:13:58,595 --> 00:14:01,298
When I was in Radley,

223
00:14:01,299 --> 00:14:03,300
Mona told me that you
were alive.

224
00:14:04,469 --> 00:14:07,138
I wanted to believe her,
but until now...

225
00:14:09,207 --> 00:14:11,909
Back in the woods,

226
00:14:11,910 --> 00:14:13,343
was that you?

227
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:16,446
Were you a part of it?

228
00:14:17,515 --> 00:14:18,850
Mona told me after.

229
00:14:18,851 --> 00:14:21,386
And you let me believe
that you were dead?

230
00:14:23,055 --> 00:14:26,857
Everything I've done,
was so I could protect you.

231
00:14:28,226 --> 00:14:30,829
I want to believe that.

232
00:14:30,830 --> 00:14:32,931
Let me take you somewhere safe.

233
00:14:36,235 --> 00:14:38,003
Does Mona know you're here?

234
00:14:38,004 --> 00:14:39,538
No.

235
00:14:41,674 --> 00:14:45,143
She told me you'd
be there Friday.

236
00:14:45,144 --> 00:14:48,781
That you'd be my reward
for delivering the girls.

237
00:14:51,618 --> 00:14:54,453
How'd you find me?

238
00:14:54,454 --> 00:14:56,254
She left me alone in her lair.

239
00:14:58,758 --> 00:15:01,227
I kidnapped a seven-year-old.

240
00:15:03,463 --> 00:15:06,999
I'm the reason that Aria
and Ezra broke up.

241
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,002
So, I've earned her trust.

242
00:15:10,205 --> 00:15:12,271
It's not safe for you
to be here.

243
00:15:12,272 --> 00:15:16,209
I stopped worrying about me
a long time ago.

244
00:15:16,210 --> 00:15:18,812
What we had was real.

245
00:15:18,813 --> 00:15:20,680
I've been pretending to work
with Mona

246
00:15:20,681 --> 00:15:23,250
so I could keep you safe.

247
00:15:23,251 --> 00:15:26,019
I need you to believe me.

248
00:15:30,024 --> 00:15:32,292
And I need you to follow me.

249
00:15:50,712 --> 00:15:53,014
Do want to play a game?

250
00:15:53,015 --> 00:15:54,582
Come on, it'll be fun.

251
00:15:54,583 --> 00:15:57,219
My dad said I can
watch cartoons.

252
00:15:57,220 --> 00:15:59,921
Fine.

253
00:15:59,922 --> 00:16:02,957
But you should know that
watching TV rots your brain.

254
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:07,029
It's your choice if you want
to grow up to be stupid.

255
00:16:08,564 --> 00:16:10,465
Just sayin'.

256
00:16:14,337 --> 00:16:16,071
Okay, let's play "Guess Who."

257
00:16:16,072 --> 00:16:17,572
I'll show you a picture
of a person,

258
00:16:17,573 --> 00:16:20,842
and you tell me if you know them.
Okay.

259
00:16:22,845 --> 00:16:24,646
That's Aria.

260
00:16:24,647 --> 00:16:26,516
See. You're good at this.

261
00:16:26,517 --> 00:16:28,118
Okay.

262
00:16:28,119 --> 00:16:29,852
Do you know her?

263
00:16:31,588 --> 00:16:33,389
She didn't take you
to the carnival?

264
00:16:33,390 --> 00:16:36,059
I went with Aria's friend,
Alison.

265
00:16:39,163 --> 00:16:41,131
Is this Alison?
Nope.

266
00:16:41,132 --> 00:16:44,234
What about this?
Nope.

267
00:16:47,772 --> 00:16:51,774
What about this person?
That's a boy.

268
00:16:54,511 --> 00:16:56,380
I am going to go call
my friend really quick.

269
00:16:56,381 --> 00:16:58,849
Can I play a game
on your phone?

270
00:16:58,850 --> 00:17:01,152
Sure.

271
00:17:12,431 --> 00:17:13,530
Hey.

272
00:17:13,531 --> 00:17:14,899
I struck out.

273
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:17,902
He's seven.
Maybe he's confused.

274
00:17:19,638 --> 00:17:22,706
Hanna.
I gotta call you back.

275
00:17:40,293 --> 00:17:41,927
I don't understand, they have
the tapes and that can't...

276
00:17:41,928 --> 00:17:43,697
no, I do understand,
but those bitches

277
00:17:43,698 --> 00:17:45,031
are going to be at
the lodge at nine.

278
00:17:45,032 --> 00:17:46,933
Do you understand?
Yes, I do.

279
00:18:06,822 --> 00:18:09,022
Doesn't look
like anybody lives here.

280
00:18:10,658 --> 00:18:14,128
I shuffle between a few motels.

281
00:18:14,129 --> 00:18:16,130
Mona doesn't know
about this one.

282
00:18:23,673 --> 00:18:26,240
And red coat?

283
00:18:26,241 --> 00:18:30,310
The only thing I know about red
coat is that she's in charge.

284
00:18:34,517 --> 00:18:36,084
I know.

285
00:18:39,722 --> 00:18:41,522
You still don't trust me.

286
00:18:41,523 --> 00:18:47,395
Look, I understand why
you've been helping Mona.

287
00:18:48,665 --> 00:18:50,198
I made the same decision.

288
00:18:52,036 --> 00:18:54,403
But if I saw you hurting,

289
00:18:54,404 --> 00:18:56,605
the way I know you saw me...

290
00:19:11,522 --> 00:19:12,589
Toby.

291
00:19:57,837 --> 00:20:00,305
No wonder I was a fat kid.

292
00:20:00,306 --> 00:20:02,240
When my dad cheated on my mom
and left us to

293
00:20:02,241 --> 00:20:04,909
start a new family,
I had a box of these a night.

294
00:20:04,910 --> 00:20:06,177
But I would get some peanut

295
00:20:06,178 --> 00:20:08,780
butter and that frosting in
a can and have a party.

296
00:20:08,781 --> 00:20:11,984
Alison's right here.

297
00:20:11,985 --> 00:20:13,119
What?

298
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:15,021
She's in this picture.

299
00:20:16,889 --> 00:20:19,457
I don't remember that.

300
00:20:19,458 --> 00:20:22,895
It just popped up.

301
00:20:22,896 --> 00:20:25,430
That can't be who you saw.

302
00:20:25,431 --> 00:20:27,733
That's Aria's friend, Alison.

303
00:20:30,071 --> 00:20:31,772
No, Malcolm, that girl's...

304
00:20:31,773 --> 00:20:33,205
I remember her pretty hair.

305
00:20:33,206 --> 00:20:35,908
That's her, Hanna.
With the blue shirt.

306
00:20:39,647 --> 00:20:42,248
Spencer?

307
00:20:48,096 --> 00:20:49,237
That's Allison.

308
00:20:49,263 --> 00:20:51,361
I mean he said she was the girl
in the blue shirt.

309
00:20:51,672 --> 00:20:53,973
This is crazy.

310
00:20:53,974 --> 00:20:55,306
And you're saying,
that Shana knows Jenna.

311
00:20:55,307 --> 00:20:58,376
And that the both of them are
meeting up with Melissa?

312
00:20:58,377 --> 00:20:59,845
This is crazier than crazy.

313
00:20:59,846 --> 00:21:01,044
I mean, Radley's
looking better every day.

314
00:21:01,045 --> 00:21:02,345
I'm actually ready to check in.

315
00:21:02,346 --> 00:21:03,913
We're going to figure it out.

316
00:21:03,914 --> 00:21:05,247
I've already got it
figured out.

317
00:21:05,248 --> 00:21:07,015
Spencer's part of the A-team. Game over.

318
00:21:07,016 --> 00:21:09,117
Today it's me and Ezra. Tomorrow
it'll be you and Caleb.

319
00:21:09,118 --> 00:21:10,552
And then it's going
to be your turn Emily,

320
00:21:10,553 --> 00:21:12,253
so get ready to say
goodbye to Paige,

321
00:21:12,254 --> 00:21:14,421
'cause I promise you, A's
going to take her from you.

322
00:21:15,491 --> 00:21:17,391
Why would Spencer
do this to us?

323
00:21:17,392 --> 00:21:18,891
Guys, I don't believe
for one second

324
00:21:18,892 --> 00:21:20,325
that Spencer's on the A-team.

325
00:21:20,326 --> 00:21:21,494
Okay, if she is
working with Mona

326
00:21:21,495 --> 00:21:23,295
then there has to be more
to the story.

327
00:21:23,296 --> 00:21:25,763
We don't know what happened in Radley.
But Spencer went in

328
00:21:25,764 --> 00:21:29,066
there at rock bottom. And she
came out like a shiny new penny.

329
00:21:29,067 --> 00:21:31,101
Are you thinking
shock treatment?

330
00:21:33,805 --> 00:21:38,007
No. No, I'm saying that Mona
spent a lot of time in Radley.

331
00:21:38,008 --> 00:21:39,274
And maybe she made
some friends.

332
00:21:39,275 --> 00:21:40,876
And maybe Spencer talked
to some of those friends.

333
00:21:40,877 --> 00:21:42,810
Mona asked Spencer
to join the A-team

334
00:21:42,811 --> 00:21:44,979
on the night of
the masquerade ball.

335
00:21:44,980 --> 00:21:46,680
Did Spencer
finally take her up on it?

336
00:21:46,681 --> 00:21:48,581
Yeah, but why now?
There's a way to prove

337
00:21:48,582 --> 00:21:50,149
that Spencer's still with us,

338
00:21:50,150 --> 00:21:52,584
and if Mona's watching,
it won't put Spencer at risk.

339
00:21:59,358 --> 00:22:02,393
Really, Hanna? You're in
the mood for a dance party?

340
00:22:02,394 --> 00:22:06,861
Look, a was everywhere before
Spencer joined the A-team.

341
00:22:06,862 --> 00:22:09,264
Do you really think
we're meeting in secret?

Aria.

360
00:24:01,918 --> 00:24:03,885
I took the job.

361
00:24:09,091 --> 00:24:11,158
You remember what you
said at Ali's funeral?

362
00:24:14,528 --> 00:24:17,262
You were right. There never
was a happy ending for us.

363
00:24:21,534 --> 00:24:24,668
You know, this doesn't
have to be forever.

364
00:24:24,669 --> 00:24:25,969
You're graduating
in seven months.

365
00:24:25,970 --> 00:24:28,871
And I wish that
I could hold onto that.

366
00:24:28,872 --> 00:24:29,805
But, it's too hard.

367
00:24:33,309 --> 00:24:35,376
I need to move on,
and so do you.

368
00:24:43,351 --> 00:24:45,352
Bye, Ezra.

369
00:25:32,589 --> 00:25:34,821
And what a win for the Red Devils!

370
00:27:12,398 --> 00:27:13,698
What is this?

371
00:27:13,699 --> 00:27:16,166
You followed me here,
that means you don't

372
00:27:16,167 --> 00:27:17,167
know who she is, either.

373
00:27:18,970 --> 00:27:20,169
And if you don't
know who she is,

374
00:27:20,170 --> 00:27:22,071
that means you're
still one of us.

375
00:27:31,048 --> 00:27:32,337
Look Spencer...
Whatever it is,

376
00:27:32,354 --> 00:27:33,788
no matter how deep
you're into this,

377
00:27:33,789 --> 00:27:36,123
you know that you can
tell us the truth, right?

378
00:27:36,124 --> 00:27:37,725
We want to help you.

379
00:27:44,764 --> 00:27:48,366
Mona came to see me at Radley.

380
00:27:48,367 --> 00:27:51,301
And when I found Toby
in the woods,

381
00:27:51,302 --> 00:27:53,069
she'd planned the whole thing.

382
00:27:53,070 --> 00:27:54,671
She wanted to break
me so that she could

383
00:27:54,672 --> 00:27:57,272
put me back together.
Like her own humpty dumpty.

384
00:27:57,273 --> 00:27:59,875
So, Mona made you an offer
you couldn't refuse?

385
00:27:59,876 --> 00:28:03,210
She told me that
Toby was still alive.

386
00:28:03,211 --> 00:28:04,512
Toby's alive?

387
00:28:04,513 --> 00:28:06,547
And it's true.

388
00:28:07,948 --> 00:28:10,450
It's true, he's been
working with Mona because

389
00:28:10,451 --> 00:28:12,151
he found out about red coat
and Mona's the only person

390
00:28:12,152 --> 00:28:14,351
who knows who she is.

391
00:28:14,352 --> 00:28:17,054
And you've seen him?
Yeah.

392
00:28:17,055 --> 00:28:18,589
Last night.

393
00:28:19,990 --> 00:28:23,159
He's on our side.
You guys, he always was.

394
00:28:23,174 --> 00:28:25,875
But this party tomorrow, it's a set-up.

395
00:28:25,876 --> 00:28:27,710
Red coat just wants us all
to be together.

396
00:28:27,711 --> 00:28:30,712
Why? What's she gonna do to us?
I don't know.

397
00:28:30,713 --> 00:28:33,147
But we're not going
to let it happen.

398
00:28:33,148 --> 00:28:35,015
Okay, whatever it is,
we're one step ahead of her,

399
00:28:35,016 --> 00:28:37,517
finally, and there are
two of us on the inside.

400
00:28:37,518 --> 00:28:39,185
And when were you going
to clue us in on

401
00:28:39,186 --> 00:28:41,387
your double agent status,
Nikita?

402
00:28:41,388 --> 00:28:44,323
I'm the one who sent you
the picture of me and Ali.

403
00:28:44,324 --> 00:28:45,957
And you did exactly what
I needed you to do.

404
00:28:45,958 --> 00:28:47,891
Because Mona watches
my every move.

405
00:28:47,892 --> 00:28:51,061
You've found a way to get to me
without her knowing about it.

406
00:28:51,062 --> 00:28:54,096
So, instead of red coat
waiting for us tomorrow,

407
00:28:54,097 --> 00:28:55,431
we'll be waiting for her.

408
00:28:55,432 --> 00:28:57,032
And if we're lucky,
this will all be over with.

409
00:28:58,167 --> 00:29:00,335
Luck won't have
anything to do with it.

410
00:29:29,191 --> 00:29:31,458
All right, good morning.

411
00:29:31,459 --> 00:29:33,325
My name is Mister Fitz.

412
00:29:33,326 --> 00:29:35,694
And I'm back as
your substitute teacher.

413
00:29:35,695 --> 00:29:37,963
Uh, if we open up to Chapter One,

414
00:29:37,964 --> 00:29:40,364
we'll find out why Hemingway said,

415
00:29:40,365 --> 00:29:43,400
"All things truly wicked,
start from innocence."

416
00:30:01,347 --> 00:30:03,516
It's perfect timing, actually.

417
00:30:03,517 --> 00:30:04,949
I need a pick-me-up.

418
00:30:04,950 --> 00:30:07,384
That place is really nice.

419
00:30:07,385 --> 00:30:10,587
It's the Hastings. Were you
expecting "donuts and dogs"?

420
00:30:11,788 --> 00:30:14,289
How can you afford
new miu mius?

421
00:30:14,290 --> 00:30:16,191
Oh! I borrowed them.

422
00:30:16,192 --> 00:30:18,560
The store gives full
refunds for returns.

423
00:30:18,561 --> 00:30:19,961
That's if you don't wear them.

424
00:30:19,962 --> 00:30:21,996
Doesn't say that
on the receipt.

425
00:30:36,607 --> 00:30:37,641
They're running late.

426
00:30:37,642 --> 00:30:39,274
How late?

427
00:30:48,483 --> 00:30:51,284
They're on their way.
That's all I know.

428
00:30:51,285 --> 00:30:53,352
She's expecting all
of you to be here.

429
00:30:53,353 --> 00:30:55,020
And we will be.

430
00:30:58,290 --> 00:31:01,892
You have no idea what she's
capable of, Spencer.

431
00:31:01,893 --> 00:31:05,028
Trust me. You don't
want to disappoint her.

432
00:31:05,029 --> 00:31:06,763
I saw them getting ready.

433
00:31:06,764 --> 00:31:09,931
And I have the video
you asked for.

434
00:31:09,932 --> 00:31:11,465
They don't suspect anything.

435
00:31:13,334 --> 00:31:15,068
You guys, I'm serious about not

436
00:31:15,069 --> 00:31:16,302
taking back those shoes.

437
00:31:16,303 --> 00:31:17,637
Hanna, quiet!

438
00:31:17,638 --> 00:31:19,205
We've got to get inside
before red coat shows up.

439
00:31:19,206 --> 00:31:21,840
If she knows we're onto her,
we'll never find out who she is.

440
00:31:23,043 --> 00:31:25,209
Are we sure we trust Toby?

441
00:31:25,210 --> 00:31:26,409
Spencer does.

442
00:31:26,410 --> 00:31:27,611
Do we have a choice?

443
00:31:27,612 --> 00:31:29,746
It's all according to plan.

444
00:31:32,182 --> 00:31:33,749
How far away are you?

445
00:31:33,750 --> 00:31:36,317
It's safe for you to land.

446
00:31:37,787 --> 00:31:39,788
It's finally about to end.

447
00:31:42,390 --> 00:31:44,891
You're getting what
you've always wanted.

448
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:50,329
She doesn't know
the others aren't here yet.

449
00:31:50,330 --> 00:31:52,397
I told you, they're coming.

450
00:32:00,104 --> 00:32:03,205
Why don't we for a walk
while we wait?

451
00:32:13,980 --> 00:32:16,715
I'll take care of Spencer.

452
00:32:16,716 --> 00:32:17,816
Toby?

453
00:32:19,084 --> 00:32:21,685
I know how you feel, Spencer.

454
00:32:21,686 --> 00:32:23,753
It sucks to be lied to.

455
00:32:23,754 --> 00:32:24,821
Get up.

456
00:32:24,822 --> 00:32:26,123
I believed you.

457
00:32:26,124 --> 00:32:28,057
I said get up!

458
00:32:30,659 --> 00:32:32,193
You won't get away with this.

459
00:32:32,194 --> 00:32:36,062
I'd say "Watch me," but you
won't be here to see it.

460
00:32:55,045 --> 00:32:56,578
If something goes wrong,

461
00:32:56,579 --> 00:32:58,614
you know what you need to do.

462
00:33:15,628 --> 00:33:17,360
Going somewhere?

463
00:33:28,948 --> 00:33:30,795
You're making a terrible
mistake.

464
00:33:30,837 --> 00:33:32,037
That's not how we see it.

465
00:33:32,038 --> 00:33:33,305
Because you don't see.

466
00:33:33,306 --> 00:33:35,507
You have know idea
what's going on here.

467
00:33:35,508 --> 00:33:36,641
We know enough.

468
00:33:48,950 --> 00:33:50,818
Who is that?

469
00:33:52,987 --> 00:33:55,288
Get to the plane.
Wait, Toby!

470
00:33:55,289 --> 00:33:58,057
Be careful. Remember why
we're here, Spencer.

471
00:33:58,058 --> 00:34:00,158
You see her.
She doesn't see you.

472
00:34:25,811 --> 00:34:27,579
What have you done?

473
00:34:41,323 --> 00:34:43,891
Mona, try your phone.

474
00:34:44,544 --> 00:34:45,010
Nothing.

475
00:34:45,024 --> 00:34:47,080
How can you not have a signal?
We saw you make a call.

476
00:34:47,230 --> 00:34:49,325
It's her. Don't you get it?
She can do anything.

477
00:34:49,330 --> 00:34:51,035
She's everywhere
and she's nowhere.

478
00:34:52,431 --> 00:34:54,098
Come on, let's get out of here.

479
00:35:02,206 --> 00:35:03,139
It's locked!

480
00:35:13,481 --> 00:35:15,814
We're gonna die.
We're all going to burn.

481
00:35:15,958 --> 00:35:17,125
Shut up, Mona!

482
00:35:17,126 --> 00:35:19,327
I'm never going
to know who she was.

483
00:35:19,328 --> 00:35:21,027
What did you just say?

484
00:35:23,096 --> 00:35:24,397
Red coat.

485
00:35:24,398 --> 00:35:25,965
I don't know who she is either.

486
00:35:25,966 --> 00:35:28,000
Are you kidding?

487
00:35:28,001 --> 00:35:29,602
You guys, we have
to get out of here.

488
00:35:52,989 --> 00:35:54,389
Ali?

489
00:38:00,663 --> 00:38:03,530
Did anyone see her?

490
00:38:03,531 --> 00:38:05,131
See who?

491
00:38:05,132 --> 00:38:08,902
Alison. She pulled me out of
there. She pulled us all out.

492
00:38:10,137 --> 00:38:12,438
No, you're hallucinating.

493
00:38:12,439 --> 00:38:14,072
She was here.
I swear it.

494
00:38:19,545 --> 00:38:21,112
Ali's dead.

495
00:38:24,182 --> 00:38:25,616
I saw her, too.

496
00:38:28,287 --> 00:38:29,954
So did I.

497
00:38:31,389 --> 00:38:33,589
Ali is red coat.

498
00:39:12,289 --> 00:39:15,524
So all of this started
when you were at Radley?

499
00:39:15,525 --> 00:39:17,226
I made a deal with the devil.

500
00:39:17,227 --> 00:39:19,895
And she gave me a way in
and out of that place.

501
00:39:19,896 --> 00:39:24,665
At first it was fun,
having a partner.

502
00:39:24,666 --> 00:39:26,767
But then the game changed.

503
00:39:26,768 --> 00:39:28,569
She stole you from me.

504
00:39:28,570 --> 00:39:30,171
So what happened that night?

505
00:39:30,172 --> 00:39:31,838
Were you there at the cemetery?

506
00:39:31,839 --> 00:39:34,174
Did you drug me?
Did you take Ali's body?

507
00:39:34,175 --> 00:39:35,708
I don't know who drugged you.

508
00:39:35,709 --> 00:39:38,377
But I was at the cemetery
and so was red coat.

509
00:39:38,378 --> 00:39:41,179
How could you
not see who it was?

510
00:39:41,180 --> 00:39:43,047
She was wearing a mask.

511
00:39:43,048 --> 00:39:47,218
She looked just like Ali.

512
00:39:49,021 --> 00:39:50,521
That's probably
what happened tonight.

513
00:39:50,522 --> 00:39:53,123
It wasn't Ali.
It was a mask.

514
00:39:55,792 --> 00:39:57,626
Guys?

515
00:40:02,098 --> 00:40:03,431
Wait, is that?

516
00:40:04,600 --> 00:40:07,035
Somebody pulled it out
of the lake.

517
00:40:20,980 --> 00:40:23,382
Think this through, Ashley.

518
00:40:23,383 --> 00:40:25,850
How do you live with yourself?

519
00:40:25,851 --> 00:40:29,554
We're not done here.

520
00:40:29,555 --> 00:40:30,954
Hey!

521
00:40:32,423 --> 00:40:34,424
We've have to get
this out of here.

522
00:40:43,365 --> 00:40:44,966
Wait! There's more.

523
00:40:46,435 --> 00:40:47,502
It's Jenna.

524
00:40:49,304 --> 00:40:51,405
And Shana?

525
00:40:53,775 --> 00:40:55,509
They know Wilden?

526
00:41:02,916 --> 00:41:04,750
Guys...

527
00:41:04,751 --> 00:41:06,652
Look at the trunk.

528
00:41:21,464 --> 00:41:22,665
You're mine now.

529
00:41:22,666 --> 00:41:24,600
Kisses...

530
00:41:24,601 --> 00:41:26,505
A.
